# Practical AI Solutions: Leveraging Hugging Face Models ðŸ¤–ðŸš€

## Overview
Practical AI solutions using open-source models available on the Hugging Face Hub. Through a series of mini projects, this repository demonstrates the practical applications of Hugging Face's transformers library for various tasks including Natural Language Processing (NLP), audio processing, image analysis, and multimodal tasks.

## Mini Projects

### Chatbot
- **Description**: Build a chatbot capable of multi-turn conversations.
- **Implementation**: Use a small language model from Hugging Face Hub and integrate it with a chat interface.

### Translation and Summarization
- **Description**: Translate between languages, summarize documents, and measure text similarity.
- **Implementation**: Use Hugging Face models for translation and summarization tasks.

### Audio Conversion
- **Description**: Convert audio to text with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and generate audio from text using Text to Speech (TTS).
- **Implementation**: Use Hugging Face models for ASR and TTS.

### Zero-shot Audio Classification
- **Description**: Perform audio classification without fine-tuning the model.
- **Implementation**: Use Hugging Face models for zero-shot learning.

### Audio Descriptions for Images
- **Description**: Generate audio narrations describing images using object detection and TTS.
- **Implementation**: Use Hugging Face models for object detection and TTS.

### Image Segmentation
- **Description**: Identify objects or regions in an image using zero-shot image segmentation.
- **Implementation**: Use Hugging Face models for image segmentation.

### Deployment with Gradio and Hugging Face Spaces
- **Description**: Share your AI applications using Gradio and Hugging Face Spaces for user-friendly cloud deployment.
- **Implementation**: Create a simple interface with Gradio and deploy it using Hugging Face Spaces.
